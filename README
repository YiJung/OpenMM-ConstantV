 we want to define two different kinds of graphene sheets.  Some sheets will be neutral (no charge) and some sheets will carry the charge of the electrode.
However, OpenMM doesn't let us define two different residues with the same topology, so we have to use a trick.

for the neutral sheets, we add a dummy hydrogen atom, with no interaction parameters (besides a bond and angle).  These sheets are in the "graph_n" .xml and .pdb files

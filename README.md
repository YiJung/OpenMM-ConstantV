# OpenMM-ConstantV
This code is for contant potential molecular dynamics simulations within OpenMM.
Electrodes are modeled at the specified potential by solving Gauss's Law with the 
appropriate boundary conditions at each atom of the electrode.  Charges are allowed
to fluctuate with chemical environment to obey the constant potential boundary coundition.
